Installing PRAW
===============

PRAW supports Python 3.5+. The recommended way to install PRAW is via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install praw

.. note:: Depending on your system, you may need to use ``pip3`` to install
          packages for Python 3.

.. warning:: Avoid using ``sudo`` to install packages. Do you `really` trust
             this package?

For instructions on installing Python and pip see "The Hitchhiker's Guide to
Python" `Installation Guides
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_.
