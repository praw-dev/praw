Glossary
========

.. _access_token:

* ``Access Token``: A token that is obtained from authenticating with Reddit.
  The token lasts for an hour, so multiple tokens may need to be obtained.

.. _camel_case:

* ``Camel Case``: A type of variable notation where multiple words are
  seperated by upper case. For example, the glossary entry for
  :ref:`Access Token <access_token>` would be written as ``accessToken`` in
  Camel Case.

.. _creddit:

* ``Creddit``: Back when the only award was ``Reddit Gold``, a creddit was
  equal to one month of Reddit Gold. Creddits have been converted to
  ``Reddit Coins``. See :ref:`this <gild>` for more info about the old Reddit
  Gold system.

.. _fullname:

* ``Fullname``: The fullname of an object is the object's type followed by an
  underscore and it's base-36 id.

.. _gild:

* ``Gild``: Back when the only award was ``Reddit Gold``, gilding a post meant
  awarding one month of Reddit Gold. Currently, gilding means awarding one
  month of ``Reddit Platinum``, or giving a ``Platinum`` award.

.. _snake_case:

* ``Snake Case``: Another type of variable notation where words are seperated
  by underscores. For example, the glossary entry for
  :ref:`Access Token <access_token>` would be written as ``access_token`` in
  Snake Case.

.. _websocket:

* ``Websocket``: A special connection type that supports both a client and a
  server (the running program and reddit respectively) sending multiple
  messages to each other. A websocket may not wait for a client to fully
  connect before sending messages.
