Working with Refresh Tokens
===========================

Reddit OAuth2 Scopes
--------------------

Before working with refresh tokens you should decide which scopes your application
requires. If you want to use all scopes, you can use the special scope ``*``.

To get an up-to-date listing of all Reddit scopes and their descriptions run the
following:

.. code-block:: python

    import niquests

    response = niquests.get(
        "https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/scopes.json",
        headers={"User-Agent": "fetch-scopes by u/bboe"},
    )

    for scope, data in sorted(response.json().items()):
        print(f"{scope:>18s}  {data['description']}")

As of February 2021, the available scopes are:

Obtaining Refresh Tokens
------------------------

The following program can be used to obtain a refresh token with the desired scopes:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/obtain_refresh_token.py
    :language: python

This script assumes you have configured your application's ``redirect uri`` to
``localhost:8080``

When you execute this script interactively:

1. You will be prompted to provide a comma-separated list of scopes.
2. You will be given a URL that will take you through the auth flow on Reddit.
3. When you open the provided link in your browser, Reddit will ask you for permission
   to grant the application permissions to the scopes requested.
4. After clicking allow, you will have a new authorized application configured.
5. You will be redirected to another page (the application's ``redirect uri``) where
   your refresh token will be displayed and will be printed to the command line.

You only have to run this script once for each refresh token. The refresh token (along
with the application's ``client_id``, ``client_secret``) are valid credentials until
manually revoked by the user.
