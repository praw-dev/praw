   This file contains a note about dynamically provided attributes. The note
   is supposed to appear in every PRAW Model's docs page. Therefore, this
   file will be appended to their reStructuredText files with the include
   directive.

.. note:: This list of attributes is not complete. PRAW dynamically provides
          the attributes that Reddit returns via the API. Because those
          attributes are subject to change on Reddit's end, PRAW makes no
          effort to document them, other than to instruct you on how to
          discover what is available. See
          :ref:`determine-available-attributes-of-an-object` for detailed
          information.
