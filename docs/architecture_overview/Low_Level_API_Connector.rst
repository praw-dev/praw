Details
-------

The `praw` library provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with the Reddit API. At its core, the `Reddit Client` acts as the primary orchestrator, managing user requests and coordinating with other internal components. It leverages an `Authentication Module` to handle various OAuth2 flows and token management, ensuring secure access to Reddit resources. `Configuration Management` centralizes the loading and parsing of settings, making the client adaptable to different environments. All interactions with Reddit's data are facilitated through `Data Models/Objects`, which abstract API responses into intuitive Python objects. For the actual network communication and low-level OAuth2 intricacies, `praw` relies on the `Low-Level API Connector` (prawcore), an external dependency that handles the complexities of HTTP requests and responses, thereby decoupling `praw` from the underlying network layer.

Reddit Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Expand <Reddit_Client>`

The primary entry point for users to interact with the Reddit API. It orchestrates calls to other components to fulfill user requests, providing a high-level, Pythonic interface to Reddit resources.

**Related Classes/Methods**:

* `praw.Reddit <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/reddit.py>`_

Low-Level API Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Expand <Low_Level_API_Connector>`

An external dependency, `prawcore`, which is solely responsible for handling the low-level HTTP communication with the Reddit API. It manages the actual network requests, responses, and the intricacies of OAuth2 authentication flows, abstracting these complexities from the higher-level `praw` library.

**Related Classes/Methods**:

* `prawcore:527-546 <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/reddit.py#L527-L546>`_

Authentication Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Manages the various OAuth2 authentication flows (e.g., script, installed app, web app) and handles the storage and refreshing of access tokens.

**Related Classes/Methods**:

* `praw.auth <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/models/auth.py>`_

Data Models/Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Represents Reddit API resources (e.g., `Submission`, `Comment`, `Subreddit`, `User`) as Python objects, providing attribute access and methods for interaction.

**Related Classes/Methods**:

* `praw.models.submission.Submission <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/models/reddit/submission.py>`_
* `praw.models.subreddit.Subreddit <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/models/reddit/subreddit.py>`_

Configuration Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handles the loading, parsing, and management of configuration settings (e.g., client ID, client secret, user agent) from various sources (e.g., `praw.ini`, environment variables).

**Related Classes/Methods**:

* `praw.config <https://github.com/CodeBoarding/praw/blob/main/praw/config.py>`_
