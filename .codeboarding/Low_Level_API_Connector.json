  "description": "The `praw` library provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with the Reddit API. At its core, the `Reddit Client` acts as the primary orchestrator, managing user requests and coordinating with other internal components. It leverages an `Authentication Module` to handle various OAuth2 flows and token management, ensuring secure access to Reddit resources. `Configuration Management` centralizes the loading and parsing of settings, making the client adaptable to different environments. All interactions with Reddit's data are facilitated through `Data Models/Objects`, which abstract API responses into intuitive Python objects. For the actual network communication and low-level OAuth2 intricacies, `praw` relies on the `Low-Level API Connector` (prawcore), an external dependency that handles the complexities of HTTP requests and responses, thereby decoupling `praw` from the underlying network layer.",
