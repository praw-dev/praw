Python Reddit API Wrapper.

PRAW, an acronym for "Python Reddit API Wrapper", is a python package that allows for
simple access to reddit's API. PRAW aims to be as easy to use as possible and is
designed to follow all of reddit's API rules. You have to give a useragent, everything
else is handled by PRAW so you needn't worry about violating them.

More information about PRAW can be found at https://github.com/praw-dev/praw
