    """A decorator for caching a property's result.

    Similar to `property`, but the wrapped method's result is cached
    on the instance. This is achieved by setting an entry in the object's
    instance dictionary with the same name as the property. When the name
    is later accessed, the value in the instance dictionary takes precedence
    over the (non-data descriptor) property.

    This is useful for implementing lazy-loaded properties.

    The cache can be invalidated via `delattr()`, or by modifying `__dict__`
    directly. It will be repopulated on next access.
