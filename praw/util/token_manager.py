"""Token Manager classes.

There should be a 1-to-1 mapping between an instance of a subclass of
:class:`.BaseTokenManager` and a :class:`.Reddit` instance.

A few proof of concept token manager classes are provided here, but it is expected that
PRAW users will create their own token manager classes suitable for their needs.

.. deprecated:: 7.4.0

    Tokens managers have been deprecated and will be removed in the near future.
