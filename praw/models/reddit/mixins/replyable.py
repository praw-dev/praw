        :returns: A :class:`~.Comment` object for the newly created comment or ``None``
            if Reddit doesn't provide one.

        A ``None`` value can be returned if the target is a comment or submission in a
        quarantined subreddit and the authenticated user has not opt-ed into viewing the
        content. When this happens the comment will be successfully created on Reddit
        and can be retried by drawing the comment from the user's comment history.

        .. note::

            Some items, such as locked submissions/comments or non-replyable messages
            will throw ``prawcore.exceptions.Forbidden`` when attempting to reply to
            them.

        Example usage:

        .. code-block:: python

            submission = reddit.submission(id="5or86n")
            submission.reply("reply")

            comment = reddit.comment(id="dxolpyc")
